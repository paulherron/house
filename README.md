A simple one-page 'control panel' to show the status of various home automation devices: lights, temperature, etc.

The aim is to bring together API responses from various devices around the home - even if they're in very different formats - and present them in a simple way.

Items can be added by editing `index.html` and amending the data attributes so they point to the correct devices and endpoints, and mention the correct format in which to output data.
